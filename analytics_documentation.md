# Data Analytics Report: Detailed Graph Documentation

## 1. Skill Profile Heatmap

### Chart Type
Heatmap visualization

### Purpose
The Skill Profile Heatmap provides a comprehensive color-coded visualization of all your skills, grouped by domain. The color intensity represents your proficiency level in each skill, with darker colors indicating higher proficiency.

### Visual Components
- **X-axis**: Individual skills within each domain
- **Y-axis**: Technical domains (Programming, Data & Analytics, Infrastructure, Soft Skills)
- **Color scale**: Represents skill rating from 1 (lightest) to 5 (darkest)

### Interpretation Guide
- **Dark clusters**: Indicate areas of expertise and strength
- **Light clusters**: Reveal skill gaps and improvement opportunities
- **Color patterns**: Help identify domain-specific strengths and weaknesses
- **Domain comparisons**: Allow for quick assessment of relative strengths across domains

### Technical Implementation
The heatmap is generated using Plotly Express with a viridis color scale. Skills are arranged by domain and sorted by proficiency level for improved readability.

```python
fig = px.imshow(
    heatmap_pivot, 
    color_continuous_scale='viridis',
    labels=dict(color="Rating"),
    height=400,
    aspect="auto"
)
```

## 2. Domain Proficiency Comparison

## Data Analytics Methodology

### Skill Mapping & Categorization
- Skills are mapped to domains based on predefined categories and keyword analysis
- Domains include Programming, Data & Analytics, Infrastructure, and Soft Skills

### Benchmark Generation
- Industry benchmarks are calculated based on:
  - Role-specific expectations (different for Junior vs. Senior)
  - Experience-based scaling (increases with years of experience)
  - Domain-specific industry standards

### Growth Projection Modeling
- Projections use a logarithmic growth model that accounts for:
  - Current skill level (higher levels grow slower)
  - Learning goals alignment (faster growth for aligned skills)
  - Experience-based learning rate
  - Realistic ceiling effects

### Priority Score Calculation
The priority score for skill development is calculated using a weighted formula:
```
Priority = (impact_factor * 40) +      # 40% weight to impact
           (effort_factor * 25) +      # 25% weight to ease of acquisition
           (alignment_factor * 20) +   # 20% weight to goal alignment
           (level_factor * 15)         # 15% weight to current level
```

This comprehensive formula ensures recommendations balance:
- Potential value gained (impact)
- Investment required (effort)
- Alignment with personal goals
- Current skill gaps
